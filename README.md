## Live football scoreboard


### Some information from author
* I'm not sure that store matches in Scoreboard in list are good idea, but I don't have any better option, imo for current implementation is OK
* endTime for Match is not needed in current implementation
* I'm not sure that return Match in most Scoreboard function is good idea but requirements are not clear for me, imo for future implementation is OK
* I don't use too many error handlers because this library don't have too much user input, and we have control over variables
